# secure-password-generator

## Description:

Open the webpage or the applaction of the password generator. Locate the input button labeled "Generate Password". Click on the Generate Password button to move forward with the process of generating your password. You will be prompted to select and specify the length of the password you desire followed with the next prompt to generate your password.

## How it Works:

The first prompt on the website will ask the user to select the length of the desired password between 8 and 128 characters. If the user selects an invalid number the prompt will result with a message "Password length is incorrect please enter a number 8 - 128! try again". After the user selects the length of their password they will be prompted to select whether or not to include lowercase letters, followed by prompts for acceptance of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters or numbers. Their password will then be generated with the prompt message "Congratulations! Your password has been created."
